Goal of the game:
- High score chase
- Points are scored for:
	- Enemies killed
	- Levels cleared
	- Damage avoided/blocked
- Fixed points are deducted for:
	- Time spent beating each level
	- Each LOCKDOWN
	- Total damage taken
- Scaled points are deducted for:
	- Each death - 10% of total removed at the time of death

Setup:
- One or two players are in control of each ship's two STATIONS
- Each ship has (3) lives
- Game is over when lives are reduced to 0

Levels:
- Each level, players will face waves of ENEMIES in growing numbers and increasing intensity until their JUMP CAPACITOR is fully charged, and the ship can jump clear of the level.
- The JUMP CAPACITOR is charged by the REACTOR.
- The REACTOR will charge the JUMP CAPACITOR faster the ship's TOTAL HEAT LOAD is lower, and slower when the TOTAL HEAT LOAD is higher.

Game Controls:
- Each ship has two STATIONS. 
	- In single player, each station is mapped to the a controller's Left and Right Joysticks, and respective Trigger and Bumper used as inputs.
	- In two player, a station is mapped to a single controller with the Left Thumbstick, Both Bumpers, and Right Trigger / A Button used as inputs.
- Thumbsticks are used as directional input.
- Bumpers are used to SHIFT a STATION's CONTROLLED SYSTEM.
- Triggers and A Button are used to actuate the CONTROLLED SYSTEM's PRIMARY FUNCTION.

STATION:
- Each STATION can access a single CONTROLLED SYSTEM at a time.
- Both STATIONS cannot access the same CONTROLLED SYSTEM at the same time.
- OPERATING / LOCKED DOWN
	- A STATION will become LOCKED DOWN if its CONTROLLED SYSTEM OVERHEATS.
	- A STATION will return to operation when the OVERHEATED system reboots.
	- When OPERATING:
		- The STATION can actuate its CONTROLLED SYSTEM's PRIMARY FUNCTION.
		- The STATION can SHIFT access to a different CONTROLLED SYSTEM.
	- When LOCKED DOWN:
		- The STATION cannot actuate its CONTROLLED SYSTEM's PRIMARY FUNCTION.
		- The STATION cannot SHIFT access to a different CONTROLLED SYSTEM.

CONTROLLED SYSTEM:
- The ship has 5 CONTROLLED SYSTEMs - Auto Guns, Thermal Lance, Energy Shield, Maneuvering Thrusters, and Swarm Rockets
- CONTROLLED SYSTEMs, whether being accessed by a STATION or not, will contribute to the ship's TOTAL HEAT load.
- OVERHEATED CONTROLLED SYSTEMS4


Managing HEAT:
	- Each STATION's CONTROLLED SYSTEM will be represented by a CONTROLLED SYSTEM ICON, and a meter indicating HEAT.
	- As a STATION uses its CONTROLLED SYSTEM's PRIMARY FUNCTION, its HEAT load will go up.
	- While any CONTROLLED SYSTEM's PRIMARY FUNCTION is inactive, its HEAT load will go down. This is also true for CONTROLLED STATIONS not accessed by any STATION.
	- If any CONTROLLED SYSTEM's HEAT reaches the OVERHEAT limit, the station will be LOCKED DOWN until the HEAT reduces to that CONTROLLED SYSTEM's REBOOT THRESHOLD.
	- During that time, the REACTOR will charge the JUMP CAPACITOR at a rate commensurate with the real time HEAT load of all OPERATING CONTROLLED SYSTEMS, and the max HEAT of any 






		- The REACTOR will see the real-time HEAT load for that station.

		- The REACTOR will see the max HEAT load for that station until the station returns to OPERATING.
