Goal of the game:
- High score chase
- Points are scored for:
	- Enemies killed
	- Levels cleared
	- Damage avoided/blocked
- Fixed points are deducted for:
	- Time spent beating each level
	- Each LOCKDOWN
	- Total damage taken
- Scaled points are deducted for:
	- Each death - 10% of total removed at the time of death

Setup:
- One or two players are in control of each ship's two STATIONS
- Each ship has (3) lives
- Game is over when lives are reduced to 0

Levels:
- Each level, players will face waves of ENEMIES in growing numbers and increasing intensity until the ship can jump clear of the level.
- The ship can jump when its JUMP CAPACITOR is fully charged by the REACTOR.
- The REACTOR will charge the JUMP CAPACITOR faster the ship's TOTAL HEAT LOAD is lower, and slower when the TOTAL HEAT LOAD is higher.

Game Controls:
- Each ship has two STATIONS. 
	- In single player, each station is mapped to the a controller's Left and Right Joysticks, and respective Trigger and Bumper used as inputs.
	- In two player, a station is mapped to a single controller with the Left Thumbstick, Both Bumpers, and Right Trigger / A Button used as inputs.
- Thumbsticks are used as directional input.
- Bumpers are used to SHIFT a STATION's CONTROLLED SYSTEM.
- Triggers and A Button are used to actuate the CONTROLLED SYSTEM's PRIMARY FUNCTION.

STATION:
- Each STATION can access a single CONTROLLED SYSTEM at a time.
- Both STATIONS cannot access the same CONTROLLED SYSTEM at the same time.
- OPERATING / LOCKED DOWN
	- A STATION will become LOCKED DOWN if its CONTROLLED SYSTEM OVERHEATS.
	- A STATION will return to operation when the OVERHEATED system reboots.
	- When OPERATING:
		- The STATION can actuate its CONTROLLED SYSTEM's PRIMARY FUNCTION.
		- The STATION can SHIFT access to a different CONTROLLED SYSTEM.
	- When LOCKED DOWN:
		- The STATION cannot actuate its CONTROLLED SYSTEM's PRIMARY FUNCTION.
		- The STATION cannot SHIFT access to a different CONTROLLED SYSTEM.

CONTROLLED SYSTEM:
- The ship has 5 CONTROLLED SYSTEMs - Auto Guns, Thermal Lance, Energy Shield, Maneuvering Thrusters, and Swarm Rockets
- CONTROLLED SYSTEMs will contribute to the ship's TOTAL HEAT load, whether being accessed by a STATION or not.
- OVERHEATED CONTROLLED SYSTEMS will contribute their max HEAT load to the TOTAL HEAT load until the system is REBOOTED.
- OVERHEATED CONTROLLED SYSTEMS will reboot when their HEAT load goes down below their REBOOT THRESHOLD.
- When a CONTROLLED SYSTEM is able to REBOOT:
	- It will resume contributing its true heat load
	- The LOCKED DOWN STATION will return to OPERATIONAL.

Managing HEAT:
- Each STATION's CONTROLLED SYSTEM will be represented by a CONTROLLED SYSTEM ICON, and a meter indicating HEAT.
- As a STATION uses its CONTROLLED SYSTEM's PRIMARY FUNCTION, its HEAT load will go up.
- While any CONTROLLED SYSTEM's PRIMARY FUNCTION is inactive, its HEAT load will go down. This is also true for CONTROLLED STATIONS not accessed by any STATION.
- If any CONTROLLED SYSTEM's HEAT reaches the OVERHEAT limit, its accessing STATION will be LOCKED DOWN until the HEAT reduces to its CONTROLLED SYSTEM's REBOOT THRESHOLD.
- Until an OVERHEATED system is able to reboot, it will report its max HEAT load.
- CONTROL STATIONS have different internal behavior relative to its HEAT load:
	- Auto Guns: as its HEAT load goes up, the rate of fire will go up, and the shot dispersion will go up.
	- Thermal Lance: as its HEAT load goes up, the lance range will go up.
	- Enery Shield: as its HEAT load goes up, shield size will go down.
	- Maneuvering Thrusters: as its HEAT load goes up, the ship's speed will go up, and jump distance will go down.
	- Swarm Rockets: as its HEAT load goes up, the number of rockets will go up.
